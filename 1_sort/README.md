a = [3,4,6,1,3,6,7,8,9,2,4,5,6,7,10,146,3,4,7,8,74]

I want you to create your own sorting algorithm. Do NOT use Ruby's .sort method to make this work.

For instance:
<code>
    def sort_array(a)
       return sorted_array
    end
  </code>
I will call this method and pass the array in. It must return a sorted array.
